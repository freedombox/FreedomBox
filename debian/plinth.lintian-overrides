# Apache configuration for the Plinth itself is shipped with proper
# name plinth.conf.  However, due to the nature of the package, Plinth
# takes the responsibility of configuring various other services
# behind Apache.  The upstream hence ships various Apache
# configuration files which are enabled and disabled when user
# requests.
