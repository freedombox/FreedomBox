# Introduction

## Name

plinth - a web front end for administering FreedomBox

## Description

FreedomBox is a community project to develop, design and promote
personal servers running free software for private, personal
communications.  It is a networking appliance designed to allow
interfacing with the rest of the Internet under conditions of
protected privacy and data security.  It hosts applications such as
blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor relay
on a device that can replace your Wi-Fi router so that your data stays
with you.

Plinth is a web interface to administer the functions of the
FreedomBox.  It is extensible and provides various applications of
FreedomBox as modules.  Each module or application provides simplified
user interface to control the underlying functionality.  As FreedomBox
can act as a wireless router, it is possible to configure networking
from Plinth.  Plinth also allows configuration of basic system
parameters such as time zone, hostname and automatic upgrades.
