"""Legacy configuration helper for Dynamic DNS, kept for compatibility.

Cron jobs in the earlier implementation used to call into this script with the
sub-commands 'update' and 'success'. This action script now allows for any
arbitrary sub-command to be called and does nothing. It can be removed after
the release of Debian 12 (bookworm).
