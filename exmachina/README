### DISCLAIMER

               -----  ACHTUNG!  WARNING!  DANGER!  ----

This code is hackish and not "production quality. It represents a potential
approach to a specific problem (privilege separation for system configuration).
It has not been extensively reviewed or tested and does not represent a known
best practice.

### What is this?

exmachina is a small system configuration system which runs as separate but 
coupled client/server UNIX processes for the purpose of privilege separation:
the "server" process runs with root privileges and a python program using the
"client" library runs as any unprivileged user. The commands and parameters
that the client can send to the server are limited, though in this particular
case can of course be used to deny service (reboot or shutdown the machine) or
probably escalate privileges one way or another (install arbitrary packages,
reconfigure networks, enable callback scripts, edit system configuration
files).

The server and client processes should be one-to-one: only one client should
ever connect to the server. The init_test.sh script shows how this could be
achieved in a SysV-style /etc/init.d script.

The intended use case is writing a user-friendly web control panel for a Debian
server or router: the web designer creating the user interface should not be
overly concerned with writing secure code, and the web application itself
(possibly including lots of third party framework code, javascript libraries,
etc) should not run with strong system permissions, but core components of the
system (such as hostname, wireless access point configuration, network
settings, package installation, locale, timezone, etc) need to be modified.

See the comments in exmachina.py for more information.

### Alternatives

The most simple alternative to exmachina that has been recommended to me is to
create simple setuid/setgid programs or scripts to execute privileged system
changes, and to only allow execute permissions to those programs for the
user/group of the less-trusted user interface program. This seems to be the
current best practice. For the more complicated case of generalized system
configuration, the setuid/setgid program becomes complicated, or you need to
write and install many of them, but this is no worse that the situation with
exmachina.

Another approach is the Assuan protocol used by GPG, which has been generalized
as libassuan:

    "Assuan permits the servers, which do the actual work, e.g. encryption and
    decryption of data using a secret key, to be developed independently of the
    user interfaces, e.g. mail clients and other encryption front ends."

### Status

Basic server and client functionality implemented. Crude, and far more simple
than it may appear or the length of code would imply.

This was code was written in a weekend "sprint" for the FreedomBox project and
their Plinth web user interface in 2012. 

I may or may not maintain this code. I have hesitation even publishing it
because i'm almost certain there are implementation bugs and that the entire
concept is problematic.

Features:
* shared secret key process/privilege separation
* call augeas API: match, set, setm, get, save, move, insert, remove
* call init.d service scripts: status, start, stop, restart

In late 2012 Nick Daly (of the FreedomBox project) wrote up a brief audit of
this code and concept on his blog (https://www.betweennowhere.net/). Link is
frequantly broken.

### Dependencies (server)

* augeas configuration editing library
* python-augeas wrapper for augeas
* bjsonrpc python library

On debian (wheezy) try:

  $ sudo apt-get install augeas-tools python-bjsonrpc python-augeas

### Dependencies (client)

* bjsonrpc

On debian (wheezy) try:

  $ sudo apt-get install bjsonrpc
