        Each app must contain at least one component of this type to provide
        basic information about the app such as it's version number.

        Instead of polluting the list of properties of an app, this component
        stores them separately. This component can also be safely passed around
        to template etc. without exposing the methods of an app and without
        creating unnecessarily cyclic dependencies.

        'app_id' must be the unique ID of the app to which this information
        belongs.

        'version' is the monotonically increasing positive integer starting at
        1. It represents the version number of the app. It is used by the setup
        mechanism. When an app's version number is increased, the setup
        mechanism assumes that the setup() method of the app needs to run
        again. This is used to upgrade/change configuration/setup of a app
        when a new version of the app is deployed on users' machine.

        'is_essential' is a boolean that marks the app as mandatory for the
        basic functions of the system. If True, this app will be installed and
        setup during the first run of FreedomBox even before first setup wizard
        is shown to the user.

        'depends' is the list of other apps that this app depends on. Apps from
        this list are guaranteed to be initialized before initializing the app
        to which this component belongs.

        'name' is the user visible name of this app. It is shown as the title
        of the app in the list of apps and when viewing app details. It should
        be a lazily translated Django string.

        'icon' is the name of icon to use with this app from a predetermined
        list of icons. This is currently an icon class name from the Fork
        Awesome font. It is used when showing the app in the System section.
        Each app typically has either an 'icon' or 'icon_filename' property
        set.

        'icon_filename' is the name of the icon file, without the suffix, to be
        used with this app. A .svg file (used in the web interface) and a .png
        file (currently used by Android App) must be provided by the app. It is
        used in the primary app page and on the app listing page. Each app
        typically has either an 'icon' or 'icon_filename' property set.

        'short_description' is the user visible generic name of the app. For
        example, for the 'Tor' app the short description is 'Anonymity
        Network'. It is shown along with the name of the app in the list of
        apps and when viewing the app's main page. It should be a lazily
        translated Django string.

        'description' is the user visible full description of the app. It is
        shown along in the app page along with other app details. It should be
        a list of lazily translated Django strings. Each string is rendered as
        a paragraph on the page. It may contain HTML <a> tags to provide links
        to external content.

        'manual_page' is the optional name of the page for this app in the user
        manual. If provided, a 'Learn more...' link appears in the app page for
        this app.

        'clients' is the list of applications that can be used with the
        services provided by this app. This is used to suggest installation of
        compatible clients on desktop, web and mobile. This is a list of
        dictionaries who structure is documented in plinth.clients.

        'donation_url' is a link to a webpage that describes how to
        donate to the upstream project.
