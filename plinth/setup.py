class ForceUpgrader():
    """Find and upgrade packages by force when conffile prompt is needed.

    Primary duty here is take responsibility of packages that will be rejected
    by unattended-upgrades for upgrades. Only packages that apps manage are
    handled as that is only case in which we know how to deal with
    configuration file changes. Roughly, we will read old configuration file,
    force upgrade the package with new configuration and then apply the old
    preferences on it.

    When upgrades packages, many things have to be kept in mind. The following
    is the understanding on how unattended-upgrades does its upgrades. These
    precautions need to be taken into account whenever relevant.

    Checks done by unattended upgrades before upgrading:
    - Check if today is a configured patch day.
    - Check if running on development release.
    - Cache does not have broken packages.
    - Whether system (and hence this process itself) is shutting down.
    - System is on AC Power (if configured).
    - Whether system is on a metered connection.
    - Package system is locked.
    - Check if dpkg journal is dirty and fix it.
    - Take care that upgrade process does not terminate/crash self.
    - Check if cache has broken dependencies.
    - Remove auto removable packages.
    - Download all packages before upgrade
    - Perform conffile prompt checks
      - Ignore if dpkg options has --force-confold or --force-confnew

    Unattended upgrades checks for configuration file prompts as follows:
    - Package downloaded successfully.
    - Package is complete.
    - File is available.
    - Package is trusted.
    - Package is not in denylist.
    - Package extension is .deb.
    - Get conffiles values from control data of .deb.
    - Read from /var/lib/dpkg/status, Package and Conffiles section.
    - Read each conffile from system and compute md5sum.
    - If new package md5sum == dpkg status md5 == file's md5 then no conffile
      prompt.
    - If conffiles in new package not found in dpkg status but found on system
      with different md5sum, conffile prompt is available.

    Filtering of packages to upgrade is done as follows:
    - Packages is upgradable.
    - Remove packages from denylist
    - Remove packages unless in allowlist or allowlist is empty
    - Package in allowed origins
    - Don't consider packages that require restart (if configured).
    - Package dependencies satisfy origins, denylist and allowlist.
    - Order packages alphabetically (order changes when upgrading in minimal
      steps).

    The upgrade process looks like:
    - Check for install while shutting down.
    - Check for dry run.
    - Mail list of changes.
    - Upgrade in minimal steps.
    - Clean downloaded packages.
