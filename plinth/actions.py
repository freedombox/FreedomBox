"""Run specified actions.

Actions run commands with this contract (version 1.1):

1. (promise) Super-user actions run as root.  Normal actions do not.

2. (promise) The actions directory can't be changed at run time.

   This guarantees that we can only select from the correct set of actions.

3. (restriction) Only whitelisted actions can run.

   A. Scripts in a directory above the actions directory can't be run.

      Arguments (and options) can't coerce the system to run actions in
      directories above the actions directory.

      Arguments that fail this validation will raise a ValueError.

   B. Scripts in a directory beneath the actions directory can't be run.

      Arguments (and options) can't coerce the system to run actions in
      sub-directories of the actions directory.

      (An important side-effect of this is that the system will not try to
       follow symlinks to other action directories.)

      Arguments that fail this validation will raise a ValueError.

   C. Only one action can be called at a time.

      This prevents us from appending multiple (unexpected) actions to
      the call.  Any special shell characters in the action name will
      simply be treated as the action itself when trying to search for
      an action.  The action will then not be found.

      $ action="echo '$options'; echo 'oops'"
      $ options="hi"
      $ $action # oops, the file system is gone!

      Arguments that fail this validation will raise a ValueError.

   D. Options can't be used to run other actions:

      $ action="echo '$options'"
      $ options="hi'; rm -rf /;'"
      $ $action # oops, the file system is gone!

      Any option that tries to include special shell characters will
      simply be treated as an option with special characters and will
      not be interpreted by the shell.

      Any call wishing to include special shell characters in options
      list does not need to escape them.  They are taken care of.  The
      option string is passed to the action exactly as it is passed in.

   E. Actions must exist in the actions directory.

4. (promise) Options are passed as arguments to the action.

   Options can be provided as a list or as a tuple.

5. (promise) Output is returned from the command.  In case of an
   error, ActionError is raised with action, output and error strings
   as arguments.

6. (limitation) Providing the process with input is not possible.

   Don't expect to give the process additional input after it's started.  Any
   interaction with the spawned process must be carried out through some other
   method (maybe the process opens a socket, or something).

7. Option
