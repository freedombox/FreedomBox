<h2>{% trans "SIP Proxy (Repro)" %}</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  Repro is a SIP proxy service that a SIP softphone can connect to. Before
  using Repro, the domain and users will need to be configured using the
  web-based configuration panel, available at
  <a href="/repro/domains.html">/repro/domains.html</a>. Users in the
  <i>admin</i> group will be able to log in to the Repro configuration panel.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  <b>Note:</b> After setting the domain, it is required to restart the Repro
  service. Disable the service using the checkbox and Update setup button
  below. Then, re-enable the service.

  To make SIP calls, a client application is needed. Available clients include
  <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a> (for computers) and
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.csipsimple">
    CSipSimple</a> (for Android phones).
