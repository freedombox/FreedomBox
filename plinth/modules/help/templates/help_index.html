<h2>Help</h2>
<p>There are a variety of places to go for help with
{{ cfg.product_name }} and the box it runs on.</p>

<p>This front end has a <a href="{% url 'help:helppage' 'plinth' %}">
developer's manual</a>.  It isn't complete, but it is the first place
to look.  Feel free to offer suggestions, edits, and screenshots for
completing it!</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox" target="_blank">A
section of the Debian wiki</a> is devoted to the {{ cfg.box_name }}.
At some point the documentation in the wiki and the documentation in
the manual should dovetail.</p>

<p>There are Debian gurus in the #debian channels of both
irc.freenode.net and irc.oftc.net.  They probably don't know much
about the {{ cfg.box_name }} and almost surely know nothing of this
front end, but they are an incredible resource for general Debian
issues.</p>

<p>There is no <a href="{% url 'help:helppage' 'faq' %}">FAQ</a> because
the question frequency is currently zero for all questions.</p>
