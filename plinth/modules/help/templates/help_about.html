<p>FreedomBox is a community project to develop, design and promote
personal servers running free software for private, personal
communications.  It is a networking appliance designed to allow
interfacing with the rest of the Internet under conditions of
protected privacy and data security.  It hosts applications such as
blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor relay
on a device that can replace your Wi-Fi router so that your data stays
with you.</p>

<p>We live in a world where our use of the network is mediated by
those who often do not have our best interests at heart.  By building
software that does not rely on a central service, we can regain
control and privacy.  By keeping our data in our homes, we gain useful
legal protections over it.  By giving back power to the users over
their networks and machines, we are returning the Internet to its
intended peer-to-peer architecture.</p>

<p>There are a number of projects working to realize a future of
distributed services; FreedomBox aims to bring them all together in a
convenient package.</p>

<p>For more information about the FreedomBox project, see the
