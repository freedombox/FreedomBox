      {{ box_name }} is a community project to develop, design and
      promote personal servers running free software for private,
      personal communications.  It is a networking appliance designed
      to allow interfacing with the rest of the Internet under
      conditions of protected privacy and data security.  It hosts
      applications such as blog, wiki, website, social network, email,
      web proxy and a Tor relay, on a device that can replace your
      Wi-Fi router, so that your data stays with you.

      We live in a world where our use of the network is mediated by
      those who often do not have our best interests at heart.  By
      building software that does not rely on a central service, we
      can regain control and privacy.  By keeping our data in our
      homes, we gain useful legal protections over it.  By giving back
      power to the users over their networks and machines, we are
      returning the Internet to its intended peer-to-peer
      architecture.

      together in a convenient package.
