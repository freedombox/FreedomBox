<p>We live in a world where our use of the network is mediated by
those who often do not have our best interests at heart. By building
software that does not rely on a central service, we can regain
control and privacy. By keeping our data in our homes, we gain useful
legal protections over it. By giving back power to the users over
their networks and machines, we are returning the Internet to its
intended peer-to-peer architecture.</p>

<p>In order to bring about the new network order, it is
paramount that it is easy to convert to it. The hardware it
runs on must be cheap. The software it runs on must be easy to
install and administrate by anybody. It must be easy to
transition from existing services.</p>
