  <p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering
      capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and
      HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other
      obnoxious Internet junk.

      You can use Privoxy by modifying your browser proxy settings to
      your {{ box_name }} hostname (or IP address) with port 8118.
      While using Privoxy, you can see its configuration details and
      documentation at
      <a href="http://config.privoxy.org">http://config.privoxy.org/</a>
