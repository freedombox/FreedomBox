<h2>Anonymity Network (Tor)</h2>

<p>Tor is an anonymous communication system. You can learn more about
it from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>
website. For best protection when web surfing, the Tor Project
recommends that you use
the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">
Tor Browser</a>.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p class="running-status-parent">
  {% if status.is_running %}
    <span class="running-status active"></span> Tor is running
  {% else %}
    <span class="running-status inactive"></span> Tor is not running
  {% endif %}
</p>
{% include "diagnostics_button.html" with module="tor" %}

{% if status.hs_enabled %}
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Hidden Service</th>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<form class="form" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}

  {{ form|bootstrap }}

  <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-md" value="Update setup"/>

<h3>Bridge</h3>

<p>Your {{ cfg.box_name }} is configured as a Tor bridge with obfsproxy, so it
can help circumvent censorship. If your {{ cfg.box_name }} is behind a router
or firewall, you should make sure the following ports are open, and
port-forwarded, if necessary:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-3">
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Service</th>
          <th>Port</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {% for name, port in status.ports.items %}
        <tr>
          <td>{{ name }}</td>
          <td>{{ port }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>SOCKS</h3>

<p>A Tor SOCKS port is available on your {{ cfg.box_name }} on TCP port
9050.</p>
