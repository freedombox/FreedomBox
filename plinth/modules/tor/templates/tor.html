<p><h3>Hidden Service</h3>
A hidden service will allow your FreedomBox to provide selected
services (such as OwnCloud or Chat) without revealing its location.
Here is the current configuration:
<ul>
  <li>Hostname: {{ tor_hs_hostname }}</li>
  <li>Ports: {{ tor_hs_ports }}</li>
</ul>

<form class="form" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}

  {{ form|bootstrap }}

  <input type="submit" class="btn-primary" value="Update setup"/>
</form>

</p>

<p><h3>Bridge</h3>
Your FreedomBox is configured as a Tor bridge with obfsproxy, so it
can help circumvent censorship. If your FreedomBox is behind a router
or firewall, you should make sure the following ports are open, and
port-forwarded, if necessary:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed span2">
  {% for name, port in tor_ports.items %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ name }}</td>
      <td>{{ port }}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
<br style='clear:both'>

<p><h3>SOCKS</h3>
A Tor SOCKS port is available on your FreedomBox on TCP port
9050.</p>

    <h3>Tor</h3>

    <p>Tor is an anonymous communication system. You can learn more about
      it from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>
      website. For best protection when web surfing, the Tor Project
      recommends that you use
      the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor
       Browser Bundle</a>.</p>
