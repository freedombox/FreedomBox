<h2>Email Client (Roundcube)</h2>

<p>Roundcube webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with
  an application-like user interface. It provides full functionality
  you expect from an email client, including MIME support, address
  book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.</p>

<p>You can access Roundcube from <a href="/roundcube">/roundcube</a>.
  Provide the username and password of the email account you wish to
  access followed by the domain name of the IMAP server for your email
  provider, like <code>imap.example.com</code>.  For IMAP over SSL
  (recommended), fill the server field
  like <code>imaps://imap.example.com</code>.</p>

<p>For Gmail, username will be your Gmail address, password will be
  your Google account password and server will be
  <code>imaps://imap.gmail.com</code>.  Note that you will also need
  to enable "Less secure apps" in your Google account settings
  (<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps"
  >https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps</a>).</p>
