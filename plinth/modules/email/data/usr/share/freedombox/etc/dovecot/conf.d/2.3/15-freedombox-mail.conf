# Use sdbox, a format specific to dovecot, for storing mails. The format allows
# better performance with some IMAP queries. When this is combined with Full
# Text Search (FTS), users will get optimal web and desktop mail experience.
# Don't pick mdbox format because is requires regular expunge maintenance. We
# have enabled btrfs filesystem compression by default.

# We try to deliver all mail using a single UID 'mail' and a single GID 'mail'.
# In Debian, UID of mail user is 8 and GID of mail user is 8 as set in
# /usr/share/base-passwd/{passwd|group}.master. By default first valid UID in
# dovecot is 500.
