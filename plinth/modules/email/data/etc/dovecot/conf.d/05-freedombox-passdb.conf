# For passdb, the passwd driver looks up using NSS. In FreedomBox, NSS is
# configured to lookup LDAP with the help of libnss-ldapd. Lookup using passdb
# would have been sufficient if FreedomBox allowed all its users to login using
# pam. However, by default, FreedomBox disallows all users but 'admin' group to
# login. Hence, the need for LDAP lookup.
