  <h2>Virtual Private Network (OpenVPN)</h2>

  <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technique for securely
    connecting two machines in order to access resources of a private
    network.  While you are away from home, you can connect to your
    {{ cfg.box_name }} in order to join your home network and access
    private/internal services provided by {{ cfg.box_name }}.  You can
    also access the rest of the Internet via {{ cfg.box_name }} for
    added security and anonymity.</p>

  {% if status.is_setup %}

    <h3>Profile</h3>

    <p>To connect to {{ cfg.box_name }}'s VPN, you need to download a
      profile and feed it to an OpenVPN client on your mobile or
      desktop machine.  OpenVPN Clients are available for most
      platforms.  See
      <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Manual/OpenVPN"
         title="FreedomBox Manual - OpenVPN">documentation</a> on
      recommended clients and instructions on how to configure them.</p>

    <p>Profile is specific to each user of {{ cfg.box_name }}.  Keep
      it a secret.</p>
