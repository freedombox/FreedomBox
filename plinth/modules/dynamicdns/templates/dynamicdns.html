      If your internet provider changes your IP address periodic
      (i.e. every 24h) it may be hard for others to find you in the
      WEB. And for this reason nobody may find the services which are
      provided by FreedomBox (like your ownCloud).

      The solution is to assign a DNS name to your IP address and
      update the DNS name every time your IP is changed by your
      Internet provider. Dynamic DNS allows you to push your current
      public IP address to an
      <a href='http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/' target='_blank'> gnudip </a>
      server. Afterwards the Server will assign your DNS name with the
      new IP and if someone from the internet asks for your DNS name
      he will get your current IP answered.

      If you are looking for a free dynamic DNS account, you may find
      a free GnuDIP service at <a href='http://gnudip.datasystems24.net'
      target='_blank'>gnudip.datasystems24.net</a> or you may find
      free update URL based services on
      <a href='http://freedns.afraid.org/' target='_blank'>
      freedns.afraid.org</a>.

      If your freedombox is connected behind some NAT router, don't forget
      to add portforwarding (i.e. forward some standard ports like 80 and 443)
      to your freedombox device.
