  <h3>NAT type</h3>
  {% if nat_unchecked %}
    NAT type not detected yet, if you do not provide a "IP check URL" we will
    not detect a NAT type.
  {% else %}
    {% if no_nat %}
      Direct connection to the internet.
    {% else %}
      Behind NAT, this means that dynamic DNS service will poll the
      "IP check URL" for changes (we need the "IP check URL" for this reason 
      - otherwise we will not detect IP changes).
      It may take up to {{ timer }} minutes until we update your DNS entry in
       case of WAN IP change.
