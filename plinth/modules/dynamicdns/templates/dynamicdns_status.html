        NAT type was not detected yet. If you do not provide an "IP Check
        URL", we will not detect a NAT type.

          Behind NAT. This means that Dynamic DNS service will poll
          the "URL to look up public IP" for changes (the "URL to look
          up public IP" entry is needed for this, otherwise IP changes
          will not be detected). In case the WAN IP changes, it may
          take up to {{ timer }} minutes until your DNS entry is
          updated.
