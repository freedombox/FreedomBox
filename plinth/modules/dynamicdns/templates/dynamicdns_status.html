          Behind NAT. This means that the dynamic DNS service will poll
          the "IP check URL" for changes (the "IP check URL" entry is
          needed for for this - otherwise IP changes will not be detected).
          It may take up to %(timer)s minutes until your DNS entry is
          updated, in case the WAN IP changes.
