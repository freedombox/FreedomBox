  <h2>{{ title }}</h2>

  <p>The {{ cfg.box_name }} can be administered in two modes, 'basic'
  and 'expert'.  Basic mode hides a lot of features and configuration
  options that most users will never need to think about.  Expert mode
  allows you to get into the details.</p>

  <p>Most users can operate the {{ cfg.box_name }} by configuring the
  limited number of options visible in Basic mode.  For the sake of
  simplicity and ease of use, we hid most of {{ cfg.product_name }}'s
  less frequently used options.  But if you want more sophisticated
  features, you can enable Expert mode, and {{ cfg.product_name }}
  will present more advanced menu options.</p>

  <p>You should be aware that it might be possible to render your
  {{ cfg.box_name }} inaccessible via Expert mode options.</p>
