## On all sites, provide Nextcloud on a default path: /nextcloud
##
## Requires the following Apache modules to be enabled:
##   mod_headers
##   mod_proxy
##   mod_proxy_http
##

# Redirect .well-known URLs on the server to Nextcloud to enable auto-discovery
# of calendars, contacts, etc. without having to provide full server URLs. If
# another app providing similar functionality is enabled, only one of them will
# work based on the sort order of Apache configuration files.
