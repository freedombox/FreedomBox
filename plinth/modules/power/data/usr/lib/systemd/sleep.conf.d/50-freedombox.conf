# FreedomBox is a server that is typically always running. If applications such
# as GNOME desktop environment are installed, they could, by default, cause
# system to sleep or hibernate after a period of idleness (based on peripheral
# activity). To ensure that services are always available over the network,
# prevent all such applications from sending the system to sleep/hibernate.
#
# To override the configuration in this file, a system administration can copy
# this file to /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/90-my.conf (or /etc/systemd/sleep.conf)
# and set the values to 'yes'.
