[Resolve]
# Debian removes the default fallback DNS servers likely because they could be
# considered a privacy violation. However, when systemd-resolved package is
# first installed, the post install script recommends a reboot instead of
# feeding the currently configured nameservers from /etc/resolve.conf into
# systemd-resolved. Immediately, this causes the system not be able to connect
# to any external servers. While this may be acceptable solution for interactive
# systems and pre-built images, FreedomBox has to a) be available for remote
# access b) perform upgrades without user intervention (and without reboot until
# a day). To mitigate privacy concerns, an option to disable these fallback
# servers will be provided in the UI.
