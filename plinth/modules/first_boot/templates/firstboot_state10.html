    <h2>Setup Complete!</h2>

    <p>FreedomBox setup is now complete.  However, you should check
      the network setup and modify it if necessary.  Do not forget to
      change the default Wi-Fi passwords.</p>

    <p>To make your FreedomBox functional, you need some applications.
      Applications will be installed the first time you access them.</p>
