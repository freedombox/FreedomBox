<p>PageKite is a system for exposing {{ cfg.box_name }} services when
you don't have a direct connection to the Internet. You only need this
if your {{ cfg.box_name }} services are unreachable from the
rest of the Internet. This includes the following situations: </p>

<ul>
  <li>{{ cfg.box_name }} is behind a restricted firewall.</li>

  <li>{{ cfg.box_name }} is connected to a (wireless) router which you
      don't control.</li>

  <li>Your ISP does not provide you an external IP address and instead
      provides Internet connection through NAT.</li>

  <li>Your ISP does not provide you a static IP address and your IP
      address changes evertime you connect to Internet.</li>

  <li>Your ISP limits incoming connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
using a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies. You can use any
pagekite service provider, for example
<a href="https://pagekite.net">pagekite.net</a>.
In future it might be possible to use your buddy's
{{ cfg.box_name }} for this.</p>
