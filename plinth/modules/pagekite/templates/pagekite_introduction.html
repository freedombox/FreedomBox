      PageKite is a system for exposing {{ box_name }} services when
      you don't have a direct connection to the Internet. You only
      need this if your {{ box_name }} services are unreachable from
      the rest of the Internet. This includes the following
      situations:

  <ul>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed with box_name=cfg.box_name %}
        {{ box_name }} is behind a restricted firewall.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed with box_name=cfg.box_name %}
        {{ box_name }} is connected to a (wireless) router which you
        don't control.

        Your ISP does not provide you an external IP address and
        instead provides Internet connection through NAT.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Your ISP does not provide you a static IP address and your IP
        address changes evertime you connect to Internet.

      PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations
      by using a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies. You can
      use any pagekite service provider, for example
      <a href="https://pagekite.net">pagekite.net</a>.  In future it
      might be possible to use your buddy's {{ box_name }} for this.
