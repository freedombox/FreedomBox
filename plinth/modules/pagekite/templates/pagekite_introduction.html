      PageKite is a system for exposing {box_name} services when
      you don\'t have a direct connection to the Internet. You only
      need this if your {{ box_name }} services are unreachable from
      the rest of the Internet. This includes the following
      situations:
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      {{ box_name }} {% trans "is behind a restricted firewall." %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {{ box_name }}
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        is connected to a (wireless) router which you don't control.

        Your ISP does not provide you an external IP address and
        instead provides Internet connection through NAT.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Your ISP does not provide you a static IP address and your IP
        address changes evertime you connect to Internet.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
      Your ISP limits incoming connections.
    </li>
  </ul>

      PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations
      by using a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies. You can
      use any pagekite service provider, for example
      <a href="https://pagekite.net">pagekite.net</a>.  In future it
      might be possible to use your buddy's {{ box_name }} for this.
