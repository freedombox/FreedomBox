  <h2>File Hosting (ownCloud)</h2>

  <p>ownCloud gives you universal access to your files through a web
  interface or WebDAV. It also provides a platform to easily view &
  sync your contacts, calendars and bookmarks across all your devices
  and enables basic editing right on the web. Installation has minimal
  server requirements, doesn't need special permissions and is
  quick. ownCloud is extendable via a simple but powerful API for
  applications and plugins.</p>

  <p>When enabled, the ownCloud installation will be available
  from <a href="/owncloud">/owncloud</a> path on the web server.
  Visit this URL to set up the initial administration account for
  ownCloud.</p>
