<p>Firewall is a network security system that controls the incoming
and outgoing network traffic on your {{ cfg.box_name }}. Keeping a
firewall enabled and properly configured reduces risk of security
threat from the Internet.</p>

<p>The following is the current status:</p>

{% if firewall_status = 'not_running' %}

<p>Firewall daemon is not running. Please run it. Firewall comes
enabled by default on {{ cfg.box_name }}. On any Debian based system
(such as {{ cfg.box_name }}) you may run it using the command 'service
firewalld start' or in case of a system with systemd 'systemctl start
firewalld'</p>
