      Upgrades install the latest software and security updates. When automatic
      upgrades are enabled, upgrades are automatically run every night. You

      Depending on the number of packages to install, this may take a long time
      to complete.  While upgrades are in progress, you will not be able to
      install other packages.  During the upgrade, this web interface may be
      temporarily unavailable and show an error.  Refresh the page to continue.
