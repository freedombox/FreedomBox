<h2>Service Discovery</h2>

<p>Service discovery is a program that can discover other machines and services
running on your local network. It can also helps those other machines find your
FreedomBox, and the services running on it. Service discovery is not required,
though. Some users decide to disable it to minimize the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface">attack surface</a>
of their FreedomBox.
