    <short>Matrix Synapse</short>
    <description>Matrix is a Federated IM, VoIP and Video server.  In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to a Matrix homeserver.  The homeserver stores all their personal chat history and user account information, much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server.  Enable this if you are running a Matrix Synapse homeserver to create local Matrix accounts that can federate with accounts on other servers.</description>
