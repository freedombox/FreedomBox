## On all sites, provide Matrix Synapse on a default path: /_matrix. This is
## only useful for clients to login without specifying a server port. This is
## not useful for federation which requires SRV record or listening on port
## 8448. Further, federation requires same TLS public key to be provided to
## Apache and Matrix Synapse server.

ProxyPass /_matrix http://localhost:8008/_matrix
