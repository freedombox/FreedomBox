##
## Disable sending Referer (sic) header from FreedomBox web interface to
## external websites. This improves privacy by not disclosing FreedomBox
## domains/URLs to external domains. Apps such as blogs which want to popularize
## themselves with referrer header may still do so.
##
## A strict Content Security Policy.
## - @fonts are allowed only from FreedomBox itself.
## - <frame>/<iframe> sources are disabled.
## - <img> sources are allowed only from FreedomBox itself.
## - Manifest file is not allowed as there is none yet.
## - <audio>, <video>, <track> tags are not allowed yet.
## - <object>, <embed>, <applet> tags are not allowed yet.
## - Allow JS from FreedomBox itself (no inline and attribute scripts).
## - Allow inline CSS and CSS files from Freedombox itself.
## - Web worker sources are allowed only from FreedomBox itself (for JSXC).
## - All other fetch sources including Ajax are not allowed from FreedomBox
##   itself.
## - <base> tag is not allowed.
## - No plugins types are alllowed since object-src is 'none'.
## - Form action should be to FreedomBox itself.
## - This interface may be not embedded in <frame>, <iframe>, etc. tags.
## - When serving HTTPS, don't allow HTTP assets.
##
## Enable strict sandboxing enabled with some exceptions:
## - Allow running Javascript.
## - Allow popups as sometimes we use <a target=_blank>
## - Allow popups to have different sandbox requirements as we launch apps' web
##   clients.
## - Allow forms to support configuration forms.
## - Allow policies to treat same origin differently from other origins
## - Allow downloads such as backup tarballs.
##
## Disable browser guessing of MIME types. FreedoBox already sets good content
## types for all the common file types.

## On all sites, provide FreedomBox on a default path: /plinth

## Requires the following Apache modules to be enabled:
##   mod_headers
##   mod_proxy
##   mod_proxy_http
##
<Location /freedombox>
    ProxyPass        http://127.0.0.1:8000/plinth
    ## Send the scheme from user's request to enable Plinth to redirect
    ## URLs, set cookies, set absolute URLs (if any) properly.

    ## Ignore any X-FORWARDED-FOR headers sent by the client and their
    ## proxies. Apache will still set this header with the remote
    ## address of the client. Apache is the first and only trusted entry
    ## point for FreedomBox. Any code that does not deal with this
    ## header properly will remain safe. For example:
    ## https://github.com/jazzband/django-axes/issues/286
    RequestHeader    unset X-Forwarded-For
</Location>
<Location /plinth>
    ProxyPass        http://127.0.0.1:8000/plinth
    RequestHeader    set X-Forwarded-Proto 'https' env=HTTPS

## Send all logs to systemd journal by default. This may be overridden per host

## - To obtain the old style access log run the following command (note that the
