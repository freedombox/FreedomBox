## Allow only TLS traffic onto FreedomBox service. This is done by redirecting
## non-secure traffic to secure traffic. The redirect is permanent as
## recommended in: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-7

## Requires the following Apache modules to be enabled:
##   mod_rewrite
##   mod_ssl

<Location /plinth>
    RewriteEngine on
    # Don't redirect for onion sites as it is not needed and leads to
    # unnecessary warning.
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^.*\.onion$ [NC]
    ReWriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
