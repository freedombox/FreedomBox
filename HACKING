# Hacking

## Installing for Development

1. Instead of running "setup.py install" after every source modification, run
   the following command:

    $ sudo python3 setup.py develop

    This will install the python package in a special development mode.  Run it
    normally.  Any updates to the code (and core package data files) do not
    require re-installation after every modification.

    CherryPy web server also monitors changes to the source files and reloads
    the server as soon as a file is modified.  Hence it is usually sufficient
    to modify the source and refresh the browser page to see the changes.

2. Plinth also support running without installing (as much as possible).
   Simply run it as:

    $ sudo ./run --no-daemon --debug

    In this mode, Plinth runs in working directory without need for
    installation.  It uses the plinth.conf config file in the working
    directory if no regular config file (/etc/plinth/plinth.conf) is found.
    It creates all that data and runtime files in data/var/*.

    *Note:* This mode is supported only in a limited manner.  The following are
    the unknown issues with it:

    1. Help pages are also not built. Run 'make -C doc' manually.

    2. Actions do not work when running as normal user without 'sudo' prefix.
       You need to add 'actions' directory to be allowed for 'sudo' commands.
       See data/etc/sudoers.d/plinth for a hint.

## Running Tests

1. Run tests:

    $ python3 setup.py test

## Running the Test Coverage Analysis

1. Run the coverage tool:

    $ python3 setup.py test_coverage

    Invoking this command generates a binary-format '.coverage' data file in
    the top-level project directory which is recreated with each run, and
    writes a set of HTML and other supporting files which comprise the
    browsable coverage report to the 'plinth/tests/coverage/report' directory.
    Index.html presents the coverage summary, broken down by module.  Data
    columns can be sorted by clicking on the column header or by using mnemonic
    hot-keys specified in the keyboard widget in the upper-right corner of the
    page.  Clicking on the name of a particular source file opens a page that
    displays the contents of that file, with color-coding in the left margin to
    indicate which statements or branches were executed via the tests (green)
    and which statements or branches were not executed (red).

## Testing Inside a Virtual Machine

1. Checkout source on the host.

2. Share the source folder and mount it on virtual machine.  This could be done
   over NFS, SSH-fs or 'Shared Folders' feature on VirtualBox.

3. Run 'setup.py develop' or 'setup.py install' as described above on guest
   machine.

4. Access the guest machine's Plinth web UI from host after setting bridging or
   NATing for guest virtual machine.

## Building the Documentation Separately

Documentation has been collected into a PDF. It also gets built into smaller
files and other formats, including one suitable for install as a man page.

1. To build the documentation separately, run:

    $ make -C doc

## Repository

Plinth is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/freedombox/plinth).

## Bugs & TODO

You can report bugs on Plinth's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/freedombox/Plinth/issues).

Feel free to pickup a task by announcing it on the issue.  Once you are done,
request a merge. For information on placing a merge request, consult GitHub
documentation.

## Coding Practices

Plinth confirms to [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python
coding standard. You should check your code with *pep8* and *pylint* tools
before placing a merge request.

## Internationalization

Every module should `from gettext import gettext as _` and wrap
displayed strings with _().  We don't have the language stuff in place
yet (we have no translation files), but we need to put the
infrastructure in place for it from the start.  Use it like this:

    log.error(_("Couldn't import %s: %s"), path, e)
