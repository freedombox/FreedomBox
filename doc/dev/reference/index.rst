This section describes the FreedomBox API that is most frequently used by apps.
Note that since FreedomBox is under development and has not yet declared a
stable API, this API is subject to change. This is not usually a problem because
all the FreedomBox apps currently reside in FreedomBox source repository itself
and are updated when the API is updated.
