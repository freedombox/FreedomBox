Pine64's [[https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/|Rock64]] is a powerful single board computer.  It uses the Rockchip RK3328 Quad Core ARM64 processor.  !FreedomBox images are built and tested for this device.

'''Important:''' Read [[FreedomBox/Hardware|general advice]] about hardware before building a !FreedomBox with this single board computer.

=== Download ===

Before downloading and using !FreedomBox you need to ensure that latest u-boot based firmware is installed into the SPI flash chip. Download the [[https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-mainline-u-boot/releases/latest|latest u-boot]] to write to SPI flash and then see instructions on how to [[http://wiki.pine64.org/index.php?title=NOOB#Flashing_u-boot_to_SPI_Flash|write u-boot firmware into SPI flash]]. The gist is that you download and write an image to an SD card. Boot with SD card and wait for white LED to blink continuosly. After that power off remove SD card and proceed with !FreedomBox download.

!FreedomBox [[FreedomBox/Download|images]] meant for all "arm64" hardware work well for this device.  However, u-boot firmware must present in SPI flash (or on a separate SD card, which is not explained here).  Follow the instructions on the [[FreedomBox/Download|download]] page to create a !FreedomBox SD card and boot the device.  These images also work well for eMMC disk which an optional attachment to this board and disk drives in USB 2.0 ports (but not in the USB 3.0 port). The process for preparing them is same as for an SD card.

An alternative to downloading these images is to [[InstallingDebianOn|install Debian]] on the device and then [[FreedomBox/Hardware/Debian|install FreedomBox]] on it.
