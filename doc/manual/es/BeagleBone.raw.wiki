[[https://beagleboard.org/black|Beagle Bone Black]] (Revision C.1) is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) single board computer.  This means that the designer is actively helping people using the platform for their own designs, and supports them in adding hardware functionality and production advice. This is a part of freedom that is often overlooked, but very much aligned with the !FreedomBox goals.  !FreedomBox images are built and tested for this device.

'''Important:''' Read [[FreedomBox/Hardware|general advice]] about hardware before building a !FreedomBox with this single board computer.
