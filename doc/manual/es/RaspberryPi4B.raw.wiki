[[https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/|Raspberry Pi 4 Model B]] is a popular single board computer developed with the intention of promoting teaching of basic computer science in schools.  It is a successor to Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with better processor and ability to drive multiple displays. Both stable and "testing" images are available for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

Raspberry Pi recommends creating a bootable SD card with the [[https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager|Raspberry Pi Imager]] (rpi-imager), their official cross-platform utility that downloads an image and writes it to removable media.  !FreedomBox "stable" and "testing" images can be selected in rpi-imager under the "Other specific-purpose OS" category.

!FreedomBox SD card [[FreedomBox/Download|images]] for this hardware are also available online.  Download the "stable" or "testing" image for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.  Follow the instructions on the [[FreedomBox/Download|download]] page to create a !FreedomBox SD card or USB drive and boot into !FreedomBox.

=== Booting from USB ===

MicroSD cards are notouriously slow and prone to be corrupted. SD card corruption means that a high read/write load or a sudden power outage can make render your card unusable. It is therefore strongly recommended that you use a USB drive for your root partition. To be able to do that, you have to follow these preliminary steps:

 1. [[https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/|Download]] and install the Raspberry Pi Imager.
 2. Insert a microSD card to your computer.
 3. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager
 3.1  Select '''CHOOSE OS''' >> '''Misc utility images''' >> '''Bootloader''' >> '''USB Boot'''
 
 3.2 From '''CHOOSE STORAGE''' select your microSD card

 3.3 Click on '''WRITE'''

 4. After the writing was succesful, you should eject the card.
 5. Insert the newly created card into your Raspberry Pi and boot up the device. If it is connected to a monitor, you will see a green screen. Let your device rest for a minute, after which you can disconnect it from power and eject the card from the Raspberry Pi. It can now boot from USB.
 6. Final step: write your !FreedomBox image into your USB device, then connect it to your Raspberry Pi. Make sure you did not leave your microSD card in the Raspberry Pi.

Please note that steps 1. to 5. only need to be done once.
