== Quassel (Text Chat Client via IRC) ==
||<tablestyle="float: right;"> {{attachment:Quassel-icon_en_V02.png|Quassel icon}} ||

'''Available since''': version 0.8

''Quassel'' is an IRC application that is split into two parts, a "core" and a "client". This allows the core to remain connected to IRC servers, and to continue receiving messages, even when the client is disconnected. !FreedomBox can run the Quassel core service keeping you always online and one or more Quassel clients from a desktop or a mobile device can be used to connect and disconnect from it.


=== Why run Quassel? ===

Many discussions about !FreedomBox are being done on the IRC-Channel `irc://irc.debian.org/freedombox`. If your !FreedomBox is running ''Quassel'', it will collect all discussions while you are away, such as responses to your questions. Remember, the !FreedomBox project is a worldwide project with people from nearly every time zone. You use your ''client'' to connect to the ''Quassel'' core to read and respond whenever you have time and are available.

=== How to setup Quassel? ===
 * Within !FreedomBox's web interface
  1. select ''Applications''
  1. go to ''IRC Client (Quassel)'' and 
  1. install the application and make sure it is enabled
  {{attachment:Quassel_Installation.png|Quassel Installation|width=800}}
  1. now your Quassel core is running


=== Port Forwarding ===

If your !FreedomBox is behind a router, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router. You should forward the following ports for Quassel:
 * TCP 4242

 * Example configuration in router:

=== Clients ===

Clients to connect to Quassel from your [[http://quassel-irc.org/downloads|desktop]] and [[https://quasseldroid.info/|mobile]] devices are available.

==== Desktop ====

In a Debian system, you can e.g. use [[https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=quassel-client|quassel-client]]. The following steps describe how to connect Quassel Client with Quassel Core running on a !FreedomBox. The first time you do this connection, Quassel Core will be initialized too.

 1. Launch Quassel Client. You will be greeted with a wizard to `Connect to Core`.

 1. In `Setup Identity` page next, provide a name and multiple nicknames. This is how you present yourself to other users on IRC. It is not necessary to give your real world name.

   {{attachment:quassel-client-10-setup-identity.png|Setup Identity|width=504}}
 1. In `Setup Network Connection` page next, provide a network name of your choice. Next provide a list of servers to which Quassel Core should connect to in order to join this IRC network (such as irc.debian.org:6667).
   {{attachment:quassel-client-11-setup-network-connection.png|Setup Network Connection|width=504}}
 1. Select the server in the servers list and click `Edit`. In the `Server Info` dialog, set the port `6697` (consult your network's documentation for actual list of servers and their secure ports) and click `Use SSL`. Click `OK`. This is to ensure that communication between your !FreedomBox and the IRC network server is encrypted.
