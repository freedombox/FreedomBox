'''Available since''': !FreedomBox 24.8

Nextcloud is considered experimental in !FreedomBox having to do with the integration of the Nextcloud container in the !FreedomBox system. 

=== What is Nextcloud? ===

This page is new and needs a Nexcloud user to help with the content. This could be you!

Nextcloud is a self-hosted productivity platform which provides private and secure functions for file sharing, collaborative work, and more. Nextcloud includes the Nextcloud server, client applications for desktop computers, and mobile clients. The Nextcloud server provides a well integrated web interface.

All users of !FreedomBox can use Nextcloud. To perform administrative actions, use the "nextcloud-admin" user after setting a password here.

Please note that Nextcloud is installed and run inside a container provided by the Nextcloud community. Security, quality, privacy and legal reviews are done by the upstream project and not by Debian/FreedomBox. Updates are performed following an independent cycle.

=== Client Apps ===
If this app has or needs client applications (apart from a web browser) list these here. As a Debian pure-blend the FreedomBox wiki should be suggesting client software that adheres to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. If this is not possible it should be noted.
