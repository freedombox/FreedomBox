== FreedomBox Customization ==

<<TableOfContents()>>

## BEGIN_INCLUDE
Though !FreedomBox's philosophy is to have the user make as few decisions as possible about the !FreedomBox itself, a few options for customization have been provided to facilitate some advanced use cases. 


=== Change Default App ===

''Available since version:'' 0.36.0 <<BR>>
''Skill level:'' Basic

''Use Case'': A !FreedomBox that primarily runs only one public-facing application whose web application is set as the landing page when someone visits the domain name of the !FreedomBox over the internet. <<BR>>
e.g. A university using !MediaWiki running on !FreedomBox as a course wiki wants its students typing in the domain name into their browser to directly go to the wiki bypassing the !FreedomBox home page.

''Configuration:'' Change the [[FreedomBox/Manual/Configure#Default_App|Default App]] in the configure page to whichever app you want to be served as default.

=== Custom Shortcuts ===

''Available since version:'' 0.40.0 <<BR>>
''Skill level:'' Advanced

''Use Case:'' The administrator of a community deployment of !FreedomBox manually installs a few additional unsupported applications on the !FreedomBox and wants users to be able to transparently access them through the web and mobile applications of !FreedomBox.

''Note:'' This feature is meant to be used with applications that are end-user facing, i.e have a web or mobile client.

'''Configuration:'''

!FreedomBox reads custom shortcuts you have created from various files paths on the server. A shortcuts file can be any file with `.json` extension in the following directories: `/etc/freedombox/custom-shortcuts.json.d/`, `/var/lib/freedombox/custom-shortcuts.json.d/` and `/usr/share/freedombox/custom-shortcuts.json.d/`. Or they can be a file named `custom-shortcuts.json` in these directories: `/etc/freedombox/`, `/etc/plinth/` (only for compatibility), `/var/lib/freedombox/` and `/usr/share/freedombox/`. The file should follow the same JSON schema as the !FreedomBox API. You can refer to the JSON schema by visiting `https://<my-freedombox-url>/plinth/api/1/shortcuts`.

As an example, to add one additional shortcut for [[https://nextcloud.com|NextCloud]] app, create a file called `/etc/freedombox/custom-shortcuts.json.d/nextcloud.json` (create directories as needed).

{{{#!highlight json
{
    "shortcuts": [{
        "name": "NextCloud",
        "description": ["Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services."],
        "icon_url": "/plinth/custom/static/icons/nextcloud.png",
        "clients": [{
            "name": "nextcloud",
            "platforms": [{
                "type": "web",
                "url": "/nextcloud"
            }]
        }],
        "tags" : ["Groupware", "File sync"]
    }]
}
}}}

The corresponding icons for the shortcuts listed in the above file should be placed in the directory `/var/www/plinth/custom/static/icons/`. The file names of the icons should match with those provided in `/etc/freedombox/custom-shortcuts.json.d/nextcloud.json`.

After adding an entry for !NextCloud in `nextcloud.json` and an icon, restart Plinth by executing the command {{{ systemctl restart plinth }}} on the !FreedomBox. You can also restart the !FreedomBox from the web interface.

After restart the Plinth home page will display an additional shortcut for !NextCloud as shown below: <<BR>>

The same shortcut will also be displayed in any Android apps connected to the !FreedomBox. <<BR>>

=== Custom Styling ===

''Available since version:'' 24.25 <<BR>>
''Skill level:'' Advanced

''Use Case:'' The administrator of a community or home deployment of !FreedomBox wants to customize the web page styling of !FreedomBox.

''Configuration'': Create a file in the path `/var/www/plinth/custom/static/css/user.css` and write [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS|CSS]] styling rules. This 
file has the highest priority as per the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade|cascading rules]]. Use the web browser's developer console to understand which rules to override and how much [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity|specificity]] is needed.
