== Radicale (Calendar and Addressbook) ==
||<tablestyle="float: right;"> {{attachment:Radicale-icon_en_V01.png|Radicale icon}} ||

'''Available since''': version 0.9

With Radicale, you can synchronize your personal calendars, !ToDo lists, and addressbooks with your various computers, tablets, and smartphones, and share them with friends, without letting third parties know your personal schedule or contacts.

=== Why should I run Radicale? ===

Using Radicale, you can get rid of centralized services like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar (iCloud) data mining your events and social connections. 

=== How to setup Radicale? ===

First, the Radicale server needs to be activated on your box. 

 * Within !FreedomBox Service:
  1. select ''Apps''
  2. go to ''Radicale (Calendar and Addressbook)'' and 
  3. install the application. After the installation is complete, make sure the application is marked "enabled" in the !FreedomBox interface. Enabling the application launches the Radicale CalDAV/CardDAV server. 
  4. define the access rights:
   * Only the owner of a calendar/addressbook can view or make changes
   * Any user can view any calendar/addressbook, but only the owner can make changes
   * Any user can view or make changes to any calendar/addressbook

Note, that only users with a !FreedomBox login can access Radicale.

If you want to share a calendar with only some users, the simplest approach is to create an additional user-name for these users and to share that user-name and password with them.

Radicale provides a basic web interface, which only supports creating new calendars and addressbooks. To add events or contacts, an external [[https://radicale.org/master.html#documentation/supported-clients|supported client application]] is needed.

{{attachment:radicale_web.png}}

 * Creating addressbook/calendar using the web interface
   * Visit `https://`''IP-address-or-domain-for-your-server''`/radicale/`
   * Log in with your !FreedomBox account
   * Select "Create new addressbook or calendar"
   * Provide a title and select the type
   * Optionally, provide a description or select a color
   * Click "Create"
   * The page will show the URL for your newly created addressbook or calendar

Now open your client application to create new calendar and address books that will use your !FreedomBox and Radicale server. The Radicale website provides [[https://radicale.org/master.html#documentation/supported-clients|an overview of supported clients]], but do ''not'' use the URLs described there; !FreedomBox uses another setup, follow this manual. Below are the steps for two examples:

 * Example of setup with Evolution client:
  * Calendar
   1. Create a new calendar
   1. For "Type," select "CalDAV"
   1. When "CalDAV" is selected, additional options will appear in the dialogue window.
   1. URL: `https://`''IP-address-or-domain-for-your-server''. Items in ''italics'' need to be changed to match your settings.
   1. Enable "Use a secure connection."    
   1. User: ''USERNAME''. Your Freedombox user-name.
   1. Click on "Find Calendars"
   1. Enter your password and select a calendar
   {{attachment:Evolution-new-calendar.png}}
  * TODO/Tasks list: Adding a TODO/Tasks list is basically the same as a calendar.
  * Contacts
   * Follow the same steps described above and replace CalDAV with WebDAV.

=== Synchronizing over Tor ===

In !FreedomBox, setting up a calendar with Radicale over Tor is the same as over the clear net. Here is a short summary:

   1. When logged in to !FreedomBox interface over Tor, click on Radicale, and at the prompt provide your !FreedomBox user name and password. 
   1. In the Radicale web interface, log in using your !FreedomBox user name and password.
   1. Click on "Create new address book or calendar", provide a title, select a type, and click "Create".
   1. Save the URL, e.g., `https://`''ONION-ADDRESS-FOR-YOUR-SERVER''`.onion/radicale/`''USERNAME''`/`''CALENDAR-CODE''`/`. Items in ''italics'' need to be changed to match your settings.

These instructions are for Thunderbird/Lightning. Note that you will need to be connected to Tor with the Tor Browser Bundle. 

   1. Open Thunderbird, install the Torbirdy add-on, and restart Thunderbird. (This may not be necessary.)
   1. In the Lightning interface, under Calendar/Home in the left panel right click with the mouse and select "New calendar".
   1. Select the location of your calendar as "On the Network".
   1. Select CalDAV and for the location copy the URL, e.g., `https://`''ONION-ADDRESS-FOR-YOUR-SERVER''`.onion/radicale/`''USERNAME''`/`''CALENDAR-CODE''`/`. Items in ''italics'' need to be changed to match your settings.
   1. Provide a name, etc. Click "Next". Your calendar is now syncing with your !FreedomBox over Tor.
   1. If you have not generated a certificate for your !FreedomBox with "Let's Encrypt", you may need to select "Confirm Security Exception" when prompted.

=== Synchronizing with your Android phone ===

There are various Apps that allow integration with the Radicale server. This example uses DAVx5, which is available e.g. on [[https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=at.bitfire.davdroid|F-Droid]].  
If you intend to use !ToDo-Lists as well, the compatible app [[https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.dmfs.tasks|OpenTasks]] has to be installed first.

Follow these steps for setting up your account with the Radicale server running on your !FreedomBox.

  1. Install DAVx5
  1. Create a new account on DAVx5 by clicking on the floating + button.
  1. Select the second option as shown in the first figure below and enter the base url as ''https://<your.freedombox.address>/radicale/username/'' (don't miss the `/` at the end). DAVx5 will be able to discover both CalDAV and WebDAV accounts for the user. 
  1. Follow this video from [[https://www.davdroid.com/faq/existing-contacts-are-not-synced|DAVx5 FAQ]] to learn how to migrate your existing contacts to Radicale.

'''Synchronizing contacts''' 
  1. Click on the hamburger menus of CalDAV and CardDAV and select either "Refresh ..." in case of existing accounts or "Create ..." in case of new accounts (see the second screenshot below).
  1. Check the checkboxes for the address books and calendars you want to synchronize and click on the sync button in the header. (see the third screenshot below)

=== Advanced Users ===

==== Sharing resources ====
Above was shown an easy way to create a resource for a group of people by creating a dedicated account for all. Here will be described an alternative method where two users `User1` and `User2` are granted access to a calendar. This requires SSH-access to the !FreedomBox.

 1. create a file `/etc/radicale/rights`
  {{{
[friends_calendar]
user: ^(User1|User2)$
collection: ^.*/calendar_of_my_friends.ics$
permission: rw

# Give write access to owners
[owner-write]
user: .+
collection: ^%(login)s/.+$
permission: rw
  }}}
  * `[friends_calendar]` is just an identifier, can be any name.
  * The `[owner-write]` section makes sure that owners have access to their own files
 1. edit file `/etc/radicale/config` and make the following changes in section `[rights]`

  {{{
[rights]
type = from_file
file = /etc/radicale/rights
  }}}
 1. Restart the radicale server or the !FreedomBox

==== Importing files ====
If you are using a contacts file exported from another service or application, it should be copied to:  /var/lib/radicale/collections/''user''/''contact file name''.vcf.
