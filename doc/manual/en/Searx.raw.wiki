=== Why use Searx? ===

==== Personalization and Filter Bubbles ====

Search engines have the ability to profile users and serve results most relevant to them, putting people into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble|filter bubbles]], thus distorting people's view of the world. Search engines have a financial incentive to serve interesting advertisements to their users, increasing their chances of clicking on the advertisements.

A metasearch engine is a possible solution to this problem, as it aggregates results from multiple search engines thus bypassing personalization attempts by search engines. 

Searx avoids storing cookies from search engines as a means of preventing tracking and profiling by search engines.

==== Advertisement filtering ====

Searx filters out advertisements from the search results before serving the results, thus increasing relevance the of your search results and saving you from distractions.

==== Privacy ====

Searx uses HTTP POST instead of GET by default to send your search queries to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine|search engines]], so that anyone snooping your traffic wouldn't be able to read your queries. The search queries wouldn't stored in browser history either. 

'''Note:''' Searx used from Chrome browser's omnibar would make GET requests instead of POST.
