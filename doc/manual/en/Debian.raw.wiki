!FreedomBox is a [[DebianPureBlends|pure blend]] of Debian.  This means that all the work on !FreedomBox is available in Debian as packages.  It also means that any machine running Debian can be turned into a !FreedomBox.

This page describes the process of installing !FreedomBox on a Debian system. Currently, !FreedomBox works in Debian Stable (bookworm), Testing (trixie), and Unstable (sid).

'''Important:''' Read [[FreedomBox/Hardware|general advice]] about hardware before building a !FreedomBox with this approach.

{{{#!wiki caution
'''Use a fresh Debian installation'''

Installing !FreedomBox changes your Debian system in many important ways.  This includes installing a firewall and regenerating server certificates.  It is hence recommended that you install !FreedomBox on a fresh Debian installation instead of an existing setup.
}}}

=== Installing on Debian 12 (bookworm) or newer ===

Check the Troubleshooting section below, for any tips or workarounds that might help during the install.

 1. [[InstallingDebianOn|Install Debian]] 12 (Bookworm) or newer on your hardware. During installation choosing "Btrfs" for root filesystem type is recommended as !FreedomBox uses it take regular snapshots of the system.

 1. Update your package list.

 {{{
$ sudo apt-get update
 }}}

 1. Install `freedombox` package.

 {{{
$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install freedombox
 }}}

  * The "DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive" will avoid several configuration prompts that would otherwise appear during the install.

 1. During the installation, you will be provided a secret key that needs to be entered during the initial configuration process. Note this down. The secret can also be read at a later time from the file `/var/lib/plinth/firstboot-wizard-secret`.

 1. You can start [[FreedomBox/Manual/QuickStart|using]] !FreedomBox. During initial wizard, you will need to enter the secret noted above.

=== Tips and Troubleshooting ===

 1. !FreedomBox uses !NetworkManager to manage network configuration. If you have configured your network interfaces using Debian installer or by editing `/etc/network/interfaces`, !FreedomBox will not manage those interfaces. (See [[https://bugs.debian.org/797614|bug #797614]].)  To let !FreedomBox/NetworkManager manage your network interfaces, edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` manually and ensure that it contains only the following:

 {{{
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
}}}

 If you have already completed the setup process without doing this step, you will need to clear out the `/etc/network/interfaces` file keeping only the above lines.  Then perform a reboot.  Network interfaces will then be in the `internal` or `external` firewall zone.  This is essential for the !FreedomBox's web interface to be reachable from other machines in the network.  You can tweak network manager connections with the `nmtui` command if you wish. 

 1. !FreedomBox will use an automatically configured IP address by default. You can assign a static IP address if necessary. Network configuration changes can be done using !FreedomBox web interface or by using the `nmtui` or `nmcli` commands. `nmcli` can be used as follows:

 {{{
  nmcli con mod "Ethernet connection 1"  \
  ipv4.addresses A.A.A.A/X  \
  ipv4.gateway G.G.G.G  \
  ipv4.dns N.N.N.N  \
  ipv4.dns-search somedomain.com  \
  ipv4.method "manual"  \
  ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes  \
  ipv6.method ignore
}}}

 ...with the block capitals and somedomain.com replaced with your actual address, mask description, gateway and dns server details.
