== Backups ==

!FreedomBox includes the ability to backup and restore data, preferences, configuration and secrets from most of the applications. The Backups feature is built using Borg backup software. Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. It is designed for efficient and secure backups. This backups feature can be used to selectively backup and restore data on an app-by-app basis. Backed up data can be stored on the !FreedomBox machine itself or on a remote server. Any remote server providing SSH access can be used as a backup storage repository for !FreedomBox backups. Data stored remotely may be encrypted and in such cases remote server cannot access your decrypted data.

=== Notes for Specific App Backups ===

Unless otherwise noted here, backup of an app's data will include its configuration, secrets and other data.
