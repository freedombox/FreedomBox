'''Availability:''' MLDonkey is not available in either Bullseye (stable) or Bookworm (testing).

=== What is MLDonkey? ===

MLDonkey is an open-source, multi-protocol, peer-to-peer file sharing application that runs as a back-end server application on many platforms. It can be controlled through a user interface provided by one of many separate front-ends, including a Web interface, telnet interface and over a dozen native client programs.

Originally a Linux client for the eDonkey protocol, it now runs on many flavors of Unix-like, OS X, Microsoft Windows and MorphOS and supports numerous peer-to-peer protocols including ED2K (and Kademlia and Overnet), !BitTorrent, DC++ and more.

=== Using MLDonkey Web Interface ===

After installing MLDonkey, its web interface can be accessed from !FreedomBox at {{{https://<your freedombox>/mldonkey}}}. Users belonging to the ''ed2k'' and ''admin'' groups can access this web interface.

=== Using Desktop/Mobile Interface ===

Many [[http://mldonkey.sourceforge.net/Gui|desktop and mobile applications]] can be used to control MLDonkey. MLDonkey server will always be running on !FreedomBox. It will download files (or upload them) and store them on !FreedomBox even when your local machine is not running or connected to MLDonkey on !FreedomBox. Only users of ''admin'' group can access MLDonkey on !FreedomBox using desktop or mobile clients. This is due to restrictions on which group of users have SSH access into !FreedomBox.

  1. Create an admin user or use an existing admin user.

  1. On your desktop machine, open a terminal and run the following command. It is recommended that you configure and use SSH keys instead of passwords for the this step.
  {{{
$ ssh -L 4001:localhost:4001 -N exampleuser@example.freedombox.rocks
  }}}
  1. Start the GUI application and then connect it to MLDonkey as if MLDonkey is running on the local desktop machine. After you are done, terminate the SSH command by pressing Control-C.
