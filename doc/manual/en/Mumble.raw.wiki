=== What is Mumble? ===

Mumble is a voice chat software. Primarily intended for use while gaming, it is suitable for simple talking with high audio quality, noise suppression, encrypted communication, public/private-key authentication by default, and "wizards" to configure your microphone for instance. A user can be marked as a "priority speaker" within a channel.

=== Using Mumble ===

!FreedomBox includes the Mumble server. [[https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page|Clients]] are available for desktop and mobile platforms. Users can download one of these clients and connect to the server.

=== Port Forwarding ===

If your !FreedomBox is behind a router, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router. You should forward the following ports for Mumble:
 * TCP 64738
 * UDP 64738

=== Managing Permissions ===

A super user in Mumble has the ability to create administrator accounts who can in turn  manage groups and channel permissions. This can be done after logging in with the username "!SuperUser" using the super user password. See [[https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Murmurguide|Mumble Guide]] for information on how to do this. The !SuperUser password can be set through the !FreedomBox interface.
