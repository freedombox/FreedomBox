[[http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero.html|Orange Pi Zero]] is a single board computer available at very low price. It uses the Allwinner H2 SoC, and has 256MB/512MB DDR3 SDRAM.  It doesn't require any non-free firmware to run !FreedomBox. However, the onboard Wi-Fi module needs proprietary firmware to work.  The board is available in two versions: with 256MB RAM and 512MB RAM. The version with 512 MB RAM is recommended for !FreedomBox. Even then, !FreedomBox is expected to gracefully run only a small number of services.

'''Important:''' Read [[FreedomBox/Hardware|general advice]] about hardware before building a !FreedomBox with this single board computer.
