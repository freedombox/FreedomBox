== Shadowsocks (SOCKS5 proxy) ==

'''Available since''': version 0.18.0

=== What is Shadowsocks? ===

Shadowsocks is a lightweight and secure SOCKS5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. It can be used to bypass Internet filtering and censorship. Your !FreedomBox can run a Shadowsocks client which can connect to a Shadowsocks server. It will also run a SOCKS5 proxy. Local devices can connect to this proxy, and their data will be encrypted and proxied through the Shadowsocks server.

=== Using the Shadowsocks client? ===

The current implementation of Shadowsocks in !FreedomBox only supports configuring !FreedomBox as a Shadowsocks client. The current use case for Shadowsocks is as follows:
 * Shadowsocks client (!FreedomBox) is in a region where some parts of the Internet are blocked or censored.
 * Shadowsocks server is in a different region, which doesn't have these blocks.
 * The !FreedomBox provides SOCKS proxy service on the local network for other devices to make use of its Shadowsocks connection.

At a future date it will be possible to configure !FreedomBox as Shadowsocks server.

=== Configuring your FreedomBox for the Shadowsocks client ===

To enable Shadowsocks, first navigate to the Socks5 Proxy (Shadowsocks) page and install it. 

Server: the Shadowsocks server is not the !FreedomBox IP or URL; rather, it will be another server or VPS that has been configured as a Shadowsocks server. There are also some public Shadowsocks servers listed on the web, but be aware that whoever operates the server can see where requests are going, and any non-encrypted data will be visible to them.

To use Shadowsocks after setup, set the SOCKS5 proxy URL in your device, browser or application to http://freedombox_address:1080/
