=== What is Shadowsocks? ===

Shadowsocks is a tool for securely forwarding network requests to a remote server. It consists of two parts: (1) a Shadowsocks server, and (2) a Shadowsocks client with a SOCKS5 proxy.

Shadowsocks can be used to bypass Internet filtering and censorship. This requires that the Shadowsocks server is in a location where it can freely access the Internet, without filtering.

Your !FreedomBox can run a Shadowsocks client which can connect to a Shadowsocks server. It will also run a SOCKS5 proxy. Local devices can connect to this proxy, and their data will be encrypted and proxied through the Shadowsocks server.

Alternatively, your !FreedomBox can run a Shadowsocks server, that allows Shadowsocks clients to connect to it. Clients' data will be encrypted and proxied through this server.

=== Using Shadowsocks? ===

Shadowsocks can be used as follows:
 * Shadowsocks Client (a !FreedomBox) is in a region where some parts of the Internet are blocked or censored.
 * Shadowsocks Server (a different !FreedomBox, or another server) is in a different region, which doesn't have these blocks.
 * The !FreedomBox running Shadowsocks Client provides SOCKS proxy service on the local network for other devices to make use of its Shadowsocks connection to the server.

=== Configuring your FreedomBox for Shadowsocks Client ===

To enable Shadowsocks Client, first navigate to the Shadowsocks Client (Bypass Censorship) page, and install it. 

Server: the Shadowsocks server is not this !FreedomBox's IP or URL; rather, it will be another server or VPS that has been configured as a Shadowsocks server. There are also some public Shadowsocks servers listed on the web, but be aware that whoever operates the server can see where requests are going, and any non-encrypted data will be visible to them.

To use Shadowsocks Client after setup, set the SOCKS5 proxy URL in your device, browser or application to http://freedombox_address:1080/

=== Configuring your FreedomBox for Shadowsocks Server ===

To enable Shadowsocks Server, first navigate to the Shadowsocks Server (Help Others Bypass Censorship) page, and install it.

'''Note''': In general, a !FreedomBox should be set up as either a Shadowsocks Server, or a Shadowsocks Client, but not both!

For Shadowsocks Clients to connect to your server, they will need to know your domain name, the password, and the encryption method.

==== Port Forwarding ====

If your !FreedomBox is behind a router, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router. You should forward the following ports for Shadowsocks Server:
 * TCP 8388
 * UDP 8388
