== Service Discovery ==

Service discovery allows other devices on the network to discover your !FreedomBox and services running on it. If a client on the local network supports mDNS, it can find your !FreedomBox at <hostname>.local (for example: freedombox.local).

It also allows !FreedomBox to discover other devices and services running on your local network.   

Service discovery is not essential and works only on internal networks. It may be disabled to improve security especially when connecting to a hostile local network.

=== Troubleshooting ===

==== Unable to reach <hostname>.local ====

If <hostname>.local is not able to be reached, you may simply need to disable and re-enable the Service Discovery feature in !FreedomBox.
To do this, go to '''System -> Service Discovery''', slide the toggle to the left position to disable it (it turns grey), followed by sliding it back to the right to re-enable it (it turns blue).

To do this you obviously need other means to reach your !FreedomBox than <hostname>.local. See the [[FreedomBox/Manual/QuickStart|Quick Start Guide]] for those.
