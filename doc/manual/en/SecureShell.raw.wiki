== Secure Shell (SSH) Sever ==

=== What is Secure Shell? ===

!FreedomBox runs `openssh-server` server by default allowing remote logins from all interfaces.  If your hardware device is connected to a monitor and a keyboard, you may login directly as well.  Regular operation of !FreedomBox does not require you to use the shell.  However, some tasks or identifying a problem may require you to login to a shell.

=== Setting Up A User Account ===

==== FreedomBox First Log In: Admin Account ====

When creating an account in !FreedomBox's web interface for the first time, this user will automatically have administrator capabilities. `Admin` users are able to log in using ssh (see Logging In below) and have superuser privileges via ``sudo``.

==== Default User Account ====

 * Note: If you can access !FreedomBox's web interface, then you don't need to do this. You can use the user account created in !FreedomBox's web interface to connect to SSH.

The pre-built !FreedomBox images have a default user account called "fbx". However the password is not set for this account, so it will not be possible to log in with this account by default.

There is a script included in the freedom-maker program, that will allow you to set the password for this account, if it is needed. To set a password for the "fbx" user:

1. Decompress the image file.

2. Get a copy of freedom-maker from https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/freedom-maker/.

3. Run {{{sudo ./bin/passwd-in-image <image-file> fbx}}}.

4. Copy the image file to SD card and boot device as normal.

The "fbx" user also has superuser privileges via ``sudo``.

=== Logging In ===

==== Local ====

To login via SSH, to your !FreedomBox:

{{{
$ ssh fbx@freedombox
}}}

Replace `fbx` with the name of the user you wish to login as.  `freedombox` should be replaced with the hostname or IP address of you !FreedomBox device as found in the [[FreedomBox/Manual/QuickStart|Quick Start]] process.

`fbx` is the default user present on !FreedomBox with superuser privileges.  Any other user created using !FreedomBox and belonging to the group `admin` will be able to login.  The `root` account has no password set and will not be able to login.  Access will be denied to all other users.

`fbx` and users in `admin` group will also be able to login on the terminal directly.  Other users will be denied access.

If you repeatedly try to login as a user and fail, you will be blocked from logging in for some time.  This is due to `libpam-abl` package that !FreedomBox installs by default.  To control this behavior consult `libpam-abl` documentation.

==== SSH over Tor ====

If in !FreedomBox you have enabled onion services via Tor, you can access your !FreedomBox using ssh over Tor. On a GNU/Linux computer, install netcat-openbsd.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd
}}}

Edit ~/.ssh/config to enable connections over Tor.

{{{
$ nano ~/.ssh/config
}}}

Add the following:

{{{
Host *.onion
  user USERNAME
  port 22
  ProxyCommand nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
}}}

Replace USERNAME with, e.g., an `admin` username (see above).

Note that in some cases you may need to replace 9050 with 9150.

Now to connect to the !FreedomBox, open a terminal and type:

{{{
$ ssh USERNAME@ADDRESS.onion
}}}

Replace USERNAME with, e.g., an `admin` username, and ADDRESS with the onion service address for your !FreedomBox.

==== SSH Over Pagekite ====

If in !FreedomBox you are using Pagekite to expose services to the Internet, you can access your !FreedomBox using SSH over Pagekite. On a GNU/Linux computer install netcat-openbsd.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd
}}}

Edit ~/.ssh/config to enable connections over Pagekite.

{{{
$ nano ~/.ssh/config
}}}

Add the following:

{{{
Host *.pagekite.me
  CheckHostIP no
  ProxyCommand /bin/nc -X connect -x %h:443 %h %p
}}}

Now to connect to !FreedomBox, open a terminal and type:

{{{
$ ssh USERNAME@KITENAME.pagekite.me
}}}

Replace USERNAME with, e.g., an `admin` username, and KITENAME with your kite name provided by pagekite.net as configured in !FreedomBox.


=== Becoming Superuser ===

After logging in, if you want to become the superuser for performing administrative activities:

{{{
$ sudo su
}}}

Make a habit of logging in as root ''only when you need to''.  If you aren't logged in as root, you can't accidentally break everything.

<<Anchor(changingpassword)>>
=== Changing Password ===

To change the password of a user managed by !FreedomBox's web interface, use the change password page.  However, the `fbx` default user is not managed by !FreedomBox's web interface and its password cannot be changed through it.

To change password on the terminal, log in to your !FreedomBox as the user whose password you want to change. Then, run the following command:

{{{
$ passwd
}}}

This will ask you for your current password before giving you the opportunity to set a new one.
