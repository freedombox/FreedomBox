=== Download ===

The kits come with an SD card pre-loaded with !FreedomBox. There's '''NO need to download images'''.

However, if you wish to reset your devices to a pristine state, then you can do so with the image provided. Follow the instructions on the [[FreedomBox/Download|download]] page to create a !FreedomBox SD card and boot the device. Make sure to download the [[https://ftp.freedombox.org/pub/freedombox/pioneer/|Pioneer Edition]] images. These SD card images are meant for use with the on-board SD card slot and won't work when used with a separate SD card reader connected via USB. 

An alternative to downloading these images is to [[InstallingDebianOn/Allwinner|install Debian]] on the device and then [[FreedomBox/Hardware/Debian|install FreedomBox]] on it.

=== Build Image ===

!FreedomBox images for this hardware can be built using [[FreedomBox/Maker|Freedom Maker]].

=== Known Issues ===

 * The image that shipped with the kits uses a [[https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/u-boot|slightly modified u-boot]] from Debian and not stock Debian like the rest of !FreedomBox. So, if you wish to get the source code, please use the !FreedomBox team's [[https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/u-boot|u-boot repository]].

=== Obtaining Source Code ===

After you purchase and receive your Pioneer Edition FreedomBox, you may want to obtain the source code of the software running in it. Continue reading this section for instructions.

!FreedomBox is fully [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|free software]] and you can obtain the source code to study, modify and distribute improvements.

==== From within FreedomBox ====

!FreedomBox is made up of several software programs and you can obtain the source code to any of them. These instructions are similar to obtaining and [[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/build.en.html|building]] [[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html|source code]] [[https://wiki.debian.org/BuildingTutorial|for Debian]] since !FreedomBox is a pure blend of Debian. Using this process you can obtain the source code to the exact version of the package you are currently using in !FreedomBox.

 1. To see the list of software packages installed on your !FreedomBox, run the following in a terminal:
 {{{
dpkg -l
}}}
 1. To obtain the source code for any of those programs, then run:
 {{{
apt source <package_name>
}}}
 This requires that the file [[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-basico.en.html|/etc/apt/sources.list]] file contains the information about the source code repositories. These are present by default on all !FreedomBox images. If you have installed !FreedomBox using a package from Debian, you need to ensure that source repositories are added in the file.
 1. To build the package from source code, first install its dependencies
 {{{
apt build-dep <package_name>
}}}
 Switch to the source directory created by the ''apt source'' command:
 {{{
cd <source_directory>
}}}
 Then build the package
 {{{
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc
}}}
 1. Install the package:
 {{{
 dpkg -i ../<built_package>.deb
}}}

==== Other Ways to Obtain Source Code ====

 1. Source code for any of the packages can be browsed and searched using the web interface at [[https://sources.debian.org/|sources.debian.org]]. For example, see the [[https://sources.debian.org/src/plinth/|plinth]] package.

 1. Source code and pre-built binary package for any version of a package including historic versions can be obtained from [[https://snapshot.debian.org/|snapshot.debian.org]]. For example, see the [[https://snapshot.debian.org/package/plinth/|plinth]] package.

 1. You can also obtain the links to upstream project homepage, upstream version control, Debian's version control, changelog, etc. from the Debian tracker page for a project at [[https://tracker.debian.org/|tracker.debian.org]]. For example, see the tracker page for [[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/plinth|plinth]] package.
 
 1. You can build and install a package from its Debian's version control repository. For example,
 {{{
 git clone https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/freedombox.git
 cd freedombox
 apt build-dep .
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc
 dpkg -i ../freedombox*.deb
}}}

==== Building Disk Images ====

You can also build !FreedomBox disk images for various hardware platforms using the freedom-maker tool. This is also available as a Debian package and source code for it may be obtained using the above methods. [[https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/freedom-maker/blob/master/README.md|Build instructions]] for creating disk images are available as part of the source code for freedom-maker package.

!FreedomBox disk images are built and uploaded to official servers using automated Continuous Integration infrastructure. This infrastructure is available as [[https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/infrastructure|source code]] too and provides accurate information on how !FreedomBox images are built.

==== U-boot on Pioneer Edition Images ====

There is one minor exception to the u-boot package present on the hardware sold as !FreedomBox Home Server Kits Pioneer Edition. It contains an small but important fix that is not part of Debian sources. The fork of the Debian u-boot source repository along with the minor change done by the !FreedomBox is available as a [[https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/u-boot|separate repository]]. We expect this change to be available in upstream u-boot eventually and this repository will not be needed. This package can be built on a Debian armhf machine as follows (cross compiling is also possible, simply follow instructions for cross compiling Debian packages):

{{{
apt install git git-buildpackage
git clone https://salsa.debian.org/freedombox-team/u-boot.git
cd u-boot
pbuilder create --distribution=buster
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder
}}}

The u-boot Debian package will be available in ''u-boot-sunxi*.deb''. This package will contain 

{{{
mkdir temp
dpkg -x u-boot-suxi*.deb temp
unxz <lime2_image_built_with_freedom_maker>
dd if=temp/usr/lib/u-boot/A20-OLinuXino-Lime2/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=<lime2.img> seek=8 bs=1k conv=notrunc
}}}

The resulting image will have the modified u-boot in it. 

=== Power and reset buttons ===

The Pioneer Edition Kit has 3 undocumented buttons for RESET, BOOT, and POWER. They are legacy features originally designed to be used with Android operating system but are useful in particular cases.


{{attachment:power-buttons.jpeg|Pioneer Edition Undocumented buttons|width=320,height=257}}

Warning: '''Excessive force will break the buttons'''. The three buttons are not intended to be pushed regularly, which is why they are fragile and not easily to push.
