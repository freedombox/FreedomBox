Pine64's [[https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/|RockPro64]] is a powerful single board computer.  It uses the Rockchip RK3399 Hexa Core ARM64 processor.  !FreedomBox images are built and tested for this device.

'''Important:''' Read [[FreedomBox/Hardware|general advice]] about hardware before building a !FreedomBox with this single board computer.

=== Download ===

Before downloading and using !FreedomBox you need to ensure that latest u-boot based firmware is installed into the SPI flash chip. See instructions on how to [[https://github.com/sigmaris/u-boot/wiki/Flashing-U-Boot-to-SPI|write u-boot firmware into SPI flash]]. The gist is that you download and write an image to an SD card. Boot with SD card and wait for white LED blinking to stop. After that power off, remove the SD card and proceed with !FreedomBox download.

!FreedomBox [[FreedomBox/Download|images]] meant for all "arm64" hardware work well for this device.  However, u-boot firmware must be present in SPI flash (or on a separate SD card, which is not explained here).  Follow the instructions on the [[FreedomBox/Download|download]] page to create a !FreedomBox SD card and boot the device.  These images also work well for onboard eMMC, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 disk drives. The process for preparing USB disk drives is same as for an SD card. For eMMC, boot the board using any OS and then write the image to the eMMC similar to writing to SD card.

An alternative to downloading these images is to [[InstallingDebianOn|install Debian]] on the device and then [[FreedomBox/Hardware/Debian|install FreedomBox]] on it.
