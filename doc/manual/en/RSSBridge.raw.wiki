'''Available since''': version 22.16

=== What is RSS Bridge? ===
RSS-Bridge is a web application capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don't have one. For example, with the help of RSS Bridge you can subscribe to !YouTube channels without having to have a !YouTube account.

=== Usage Example ===
==== Subscribing to a YouTube account ====
In this example, we will see one of the ways to subscribe to a given !YouTube channel.

 1. Visit the !YouTube channel and copy its name to the clipboard

 3.#3 Paste the previously copied channel name in the '''Custom name''' section and click on '''Generate Feed'''

 4.#4 From the available feed types select '''Atom'''. If you're using a Chromium based browser, this will open the Atom feed in a new tab, which you can easily copy into your feed Reader, such as [[FreedomBox/Manual/TinyTinyRSS|Tiny Tiny RSS]]
