'''Available since''': version 20.15 

calibre is an e-book management solution. You can organize your e-books into collections in calibre known as "libraries". calibre can do e-book format conversion between most of the popular e-book formats. It can also manage metadata of your e-books such as book covers, descriptions, author and publisher information etc.

Moving your calibre library from your desktop to your !FreedomBox has the benefit of being able to access your e-books from any device on the local network or through the Internet.

Only users who are members of the ''calibre'' group have access to the libraries. You can assign users to this group via the system app [[FreedomBox/Manual/Users| users and groups]].

You might be familiar with the e-book reader shipped with the calibre application on your desktop. The server version of calibre that's installed on your !FreedomBox has a web-based e-book reader with similar look and feel. This allows you to read your e-books from any device with a web browser.

=== Managing Libraries ===

After installation of calibre, a default library called "Library" will be made available. The !FreedomBox administrator can add or delete any of the libraries including the default one from the app settings in !FreedomBox web interface.

=== Access ===

calibre can be accessed after installation through the web client at {{{https://<my_freedombox_name>/calibre}}}.
