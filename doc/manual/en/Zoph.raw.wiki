== Zoph (Photo manager) ==
||<tablestyle="float: right;"> {{attachment:zoph-icon_en_V01.png|alt="Zoph icon"}} ||

'''Available since''': version 21.3 (and Debian 11, Bullseye)

=== What is Zoph? ===

Zoph is a web based photo manager, allowing uploads of photos to the !FreedomBox server, where they can be organised into Albums, and associated with Locations, People and Categories. An individual photo can be in multiple albums, and Albums, Categories and Locations are hierarchical.

Zoph supports multiple users, and has a permissions system to control which Albums users can see, or create, whether they can see or create People etc.

For !FreedomBox the username within Zoph must match the !FreedomBox username so Single Sign On will work. 

=== Using Zoph ===

After Zoph is installed, you'll need to click "Setup". Then you can launch the web client. It can also be accessed at {{{https://<your freedombox>/zoph}}}.

Only the very first time you'll be asked for user and password. The next times you'll be taken straight to a welcome screen.

The tab menu will be shown on top of every page. From there you can import photos from any computer, administer Zoph to add other users etc.
 
You can now go to the 'prefs' tab and set your preferences, for numbers of rows and columns in results displays, how much information you wish displayed about the camera used to take the photo and so on.

You can add information about People who are in your Photos.

==== Choosing a storage location for your photos ====

Your photos will need a lot of storage space compared to the other uses of your !FreedomBox. You may want to put them onto an external disk. You can (not yet) specify in the initial install screen where your photos should be stored.
The database which holds information about albums, people etc is held in your normal !FreedomBox storage.
