<p>PageKite is a system for exposing {{ cfg.box_name }} services when
you don't have a direct connection to the Internet. You only need this
service if your {{ cfg.box_name }} services are unreachable from the
rest of the Internet. This includes the following situations: </p>

<ul>
  <li>{{ cfg.box_name }} is behind a restricted firewall.</li>

  <li>{{ cfg.box_name }} is connected to a (wireless) router which you
      don't control.</li>

  <li>Your ISP does not provide you an external IP address and instead
      provides Internet connection through NAT.</li>

  <li>Your ISP does not provide you a static IP address and your IP
      address changes evertime you connect to Internet.</li>

  <li>Your ISP limits incoming connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
using a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies. Currently,
exposing web server and SSH server are supported. An intermediary
server with direct Internet access is required. Currently, only
pagekite.net server is supported and you will need an account
there. In future, it might be possible to use your buddy's
{{ cfg.box_name }} for this.</p>
